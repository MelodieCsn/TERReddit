Also a big thanks to everyone who keeps contributing content to r\/EarthPorn! We have an overwhelmingly large amount of OC submissions, and I think without those this subreddit wouldnt be the same. \n\n---\n\n# PSA regarding Social Media Links\n\nBefore we get into the awards, a quick PSA: we've been seeing a growing number of reports on posts and comments from OPs mentioning their instagram account or website, calling for removal of them. *We want to make clear that we wont remove any such posts or comments*, in our eyes it's perfectly fine to link your instagram, and often we see users asking to see more of OPs work. You may stop reporting those comments, they do not violate any of our rules, thanks. :)\n\n---\n\n# Now on to the Winners!\n\nFor the record, here is the [nomination thread](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/EarthPorn\/comments\/ef4p2y\/earthporn_best_of_2019_awards_nomination_thread\/).\n\nTwo categories (decidious forest, tundra\/taiga) posed a bit of a problem, since the highest voted nomination ended up not quite fitting the category in our opinion. Further, we didnt get any nominations for the non-OC category, and since we havent seen anyone who really stood out in submitting a lot of non-OC we decided to drop this category. We will give the awards for decidious forest and tundra\/taiga to the next highest voted nomination that fits the category, and divide the coins for the non-OC category and give those to the highest voted nominations for decidious forest and tundra\/taiga. I hope that this is in everyone's interest. \n\nWe also received more coins than initially expected, instead of 40,000 we have 90,000 coins to spend. This means every winner will get 9,000 coins in form of 5 mod awards (each 1800).\n\n### Categories\n\n- [Best Beach photo](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/EarthPorn\/comments\/ef4p2y\/earthporn_best_of_2019_awards_nomination_thread\/fby80uc\/): \/u\/ryanchatfieldimages with [Mother Nature's color palette in Western Australia](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/EarthPorn\/comments\/bxg3vw\/mother_natures_color_palette_is_incredible_broome\/)\n\n- [Best Coniferous Forest photo](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/EarthPorn\/comments\/ef4p2y\/earthporn_best_of_2019_awards_nomination_thread\/fby81qj\/): \/u\/Tristan_100k with a [moody picture of the Black Forest in Germany](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/EarthPorn\/comments\/ef0i3a\/another_one_from_the_black_forest_1350x1080_oc\/)\n\n- [Best Decidious Forest photo](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/EarthPorn\/comments\/ef4p2y\/earthporn_best_of_2019_awards_nomination_thread\/fby82sy\/): \/u\/Charlinho58 with a [dreamy Italian forest](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/EarthPorn\/comments\/eejyte\/dreamy_forest_in_italy_oc2048x2560\/).
